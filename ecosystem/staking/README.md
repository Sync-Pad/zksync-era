This provides users with greater control over their investment and allows them to customize their staking strategy according to their individual needs and preferences. Our platform is designed to ensure that staking $SPT is both simple and rewarding, with a range of options available to suit every type of investor. With our staking program, users can earn passive income while contributing to the security and stability of the network. Start staking today and reap the rewards of long-term investment!

By staking your $SPT tokens and accumulating points through the staking process, stakers not only earn rewards, but also gain access to potential opportunities to participate in upcoming launchpads, which could give them early access to exciting new projects and potentially higher returns on their investment. Participating in a launchpad can provide users with the advantage of being among the first to invest in a promising new project or token, which could potentially lead to significant gains in the future. Therefore, staking $SPT and earning points could potentially increase a user's chances of participating in these launchpads and being among the first to capitalize on new and innovative opportunities in the zkSync Ecosystem.
